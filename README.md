# MGCustomDrawingPipeline

## Overview
MGCustomDrawingPipeline is an educational MonoGame project designed to help developers understand the fundamentals of custom drawing pipelines and shader programming. This project provides a clear, well-commented implementation of a basic 3D rendering system using MonoGame's low-level graphics APIs.

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Demonstrate how to implement custom drawing code in MonoGame
- Provide an accessible introduction to shader programming concepts
- Show the connection between C# code and GPU operations
- Serve as a learning resource for graphics programming beginners

## What You'll Learn
- Creating and managing vertex and index buffers
- Understanding 3D transformations (world, view, projection matrices)
- Writing and using HLSL shaders
- Building a custom rendering pipeline from scratch
- How vertex and pixel shaders work together in real-time graphics

## Project Features
- A rotating triangle with vertex coloring and smooth gradient interpolation
- Custom HLSL shader with detailed comments explaining each section
- Transformation matrices for proper 3D positioning and animation
- Comprehensive code comments designed for educational purposes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or other compatible IDE
- MonoGame framework

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project (F5)

## Project Structure

### Key Components
- **Game1.cs**: Main game class that implements the custom drawing pipeline
- **TriangleShader.fx**: HLSL shader file that defines vertex and pixel shaders
- **Program.cs**: Application entry point

### How It Works
The application demonstrates a complete rendering pipeline:
1. Vertex data (positions and colors) is defined in C#
2. This data is transferred to the GPU using vertex and index buffers
3. The shader transforms the vertices based on rotation matrices
4. The shader interpolates colors across the triangle surface
5. The resulting colored triangle is rendered to the screen

## Understanding the Shader
The `TriangleShader.fx` file contains a basic shader implementation with:
- Vertex shader for transforming 3D positions to screen coordinates
- Pixel shader for determining the final color of each pixel
- Data structures for passing information between shader stages
- Techniques and passes that define the rendering process

## Further Learning
To continue exploring graphics programming concepts:
- Experiment with modifying the vertex positions and colors
- Try adding more geometric primitives
- Implement additional shader effects (lighting, texturing, etc.)
- Explore different transformation techniques
